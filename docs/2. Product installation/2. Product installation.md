Step 6: Install the ESP32 board. 

Pay attention:

1.The USB port of the board faces outwards. Installing it in the opposite direction may burn the board.

2.The EPS32 board needs to be fully inserted into the EPS32 port of the integrated board to ensure a stable connection between the EPS32 interface board and the integrated board, otherwise the kit may not work properly.
